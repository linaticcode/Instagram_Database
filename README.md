# Project Overview
Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos with their followers and interact with content posted by others through likes and comments. The platform also facilitates social connections by enabling users to follow each other. To efficiently manage the vast amount of data generated by millions of users and their interactions, Instagram requires a robust Database Management System (DBMS).
